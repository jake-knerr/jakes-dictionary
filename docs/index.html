<h2 id="a">A</h2>
<h4 id="a-duck">A Duck</h4>
<p>a software feature added merely to draw attention, be noticed by management, and ultimately be removed.</p>
<p>Ducks are used to satisfy management&#39;s need to exert influence and avoid changes to other parts of the software.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-class">Abstract Class</h4>
<p>a class that can only be extended or subclassed but not instantiated.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-data-type-adt">Abstract Data Type (ADT)</h4>
<p>a data type that describes how to manipulate its data but does not describe the implementation.</p>
<p>A <code>List</code> is an ADT, and an <code>ArrayList</code> is a concrete implementation. Think of an ADT as an interface for the data type.</p>
<p>See <a href="#data-structure">data structure</a>.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-method">Abstract Method</h4>
<p>a method that is declared but contains no implementation.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-syntax-tree-ast-syntax-tree">Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Syntax Tree</h4>
<p>a tree representation of structured data.</p>
<p>The syntax is <em>abstract</em> because it does not represent every detail appearing in the data. For example, if an AST represented JavaScript source code, semicolons would be dropped because they are unnecessary to understand the data.</p>
<p>See <a href="#concrete-tree-parse-tree">concrete tree</a>.</p>
<h4 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h4>
<p>simplification by focusing on details of greater interest in a given context and ignoring everything else.</p>
<p>Put another way, the goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by removing unnecessary information. An interface to a complex system is an abstraction.</p>
<p>Put more concretely, abstraction allows for a name to represent a complex operation and allows a developer to ignore how the operation is achieved and focus on what the operation does.</p>
<p>The higher the level of abstraction, the less detail in the representation. For example, when traveling from point A to point B, a high-level abstraction focuses on driving directions. In contrast, a low-level abstraction would include details on the car&#39;s engine temperatures while traveling from A to B.</p>
<p>As a verb, <em>abstract</em> means to take away. An abstraction is the simpler set of ideas that are abstracted from a more complex set of ideas. It is useful to think of abstraction as a verb because it emphasizes how something less complex is taken from something that is more complex.</p>
<p>See <a href="#generalization-specialization">generalization, specialization</a>.</p>
<h4 id="acceptance-testing-customer-testing-functional-testing">Acceptance Testing, Customer Testing, Functional Testing</h4>
<p>testing to determine if the system complies with the requirements of the project and whether it can be delivered.</p>
<p>This is the last phase of software testing before making the system available for client use.</p>
<h4 id="access-control">Access Control</h4>
<p>a feature of classical OOP that determines how an object&#39;s properties can be accessed via keywords like <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, etc.</p>

<p>simply reads data and does not change data.</p>
<p>See <a href="#mutator-method-setter">mutator method</a>.</p>
<h4 id="accumulator">Accumulator</h4>
<p>a variable used to store intermediate results — for example, a variable in a loop that is added to in successive iterations.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">for <span class="hljs-comment">(let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</span> {} <span class="hljs-comment">// i is the accumulator</span>
</code></pre>
<h4 id="architecture-vs-design">Architecture vs. Design</h4>
<p>architecture is concerned with the design of software in the broadest sense. Think layers and high-level modules and how they interact with one another. Changes to architecture generally cause changes to the entire codebase.</p>
<p>Design is more localized and affects a smaller and more specific part of the application. Changes to design may not trigger application-wide changes.</p>
<h4 id="action-comment">Action Comment</h4>
<p>a type of comment that signals the need for some action to be taken.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;rewrite code below&quot; is an action comment.</p>
<h4 id="acyclic">Acyclic</h4>
<p>literally, not forming a cycle.</p>
<p>In programming terms, it acyclic generally means no looping.</p>
<h4 id="ada">Ada</h4>
<p>a compiled and strongly typed language that extends Pascal and other languages.</p>
<p>Ada was first designed in 1980 by Frenchman Jean Ichbiah and is named after Ada Lovelace.</p>
<p>See <a href="#ada-lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ada-lovelace">Ada Lovelace</h4>

<p>Born 1815 in London, Ada was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron.</p>
<h4 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h4>
<p>a program that functions as the entry point into a collection of backend services, often providing authentication, security, and request routing services.</p>
<h4 id="agile-software-development">Agile Software Development</h4>
<p>very generally, an iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.</p>
<p>The &quot;Agile Manifesto&quot; introduced the term in 2001 after a conference of 17 developers. Scrum &amp; Extreme Programming are two typical examples.</p>
<h4 id="algebra-laws-associative-commutative-distributive-identity">Algebra Laws: Associative, Commutative, Distributive, Identity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Associative.<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Commutative.<ul>
<li>Addition and multiplication only.</li>
<li><code>a + b = b + a</code></li>

<h4 id="anemic-objects-anemic-domain-model">Anemic Objects, Anemic Domain Model</h4>
<p>domain objects that have little or no behavior.</p>
<p>Anemic objects are pure data objects (or nearly pure). Some people consider them an antipattern because they go against the tenet of OOP that objects encapsulate data and behavior rather than just data.</p>
<h4 id="annotations">Annotations</h4>
<p>metadata in code that does not directly affect the code but can be used by a compiler.</p>
<p>For example, JSDoc comments in JavaScript code are annotations. Anecdotally, annotations are consumed by a different compiler than the code compiler.</p>
<h4 id="anonymous-function-lambda-function">Anonymous Function, Lambda Function</h4>
<p>a function definition that is not bound to an identifier.</p>

<p>a functor that supports an <code>ap</code> method; <code>ap</code> allows a functor that wraps a function to apply this function to the wrapped value of another functor of the same type.</p>
<p>Often, the <code>ap</code> method is used by a functor that wraps a function to get arguments for the function from other functors.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// getJSON :: String -&gt; Task</span>

<h4 id="architecture-astronauts">Architecture Astronauts</h4>
<p>developers who spend their energy on architecture instead of writing code.</p>
<h4 id="arguments">Arguments</h4>
<p>the values passed to an invoked function.</p>
<p>Do not confuse arguments with parameters, which are the variables listed as part of a function definition.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">fn</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x, y</span>) </span>{} <span class="hljs-comment">// parameters x and y</span>

<p>Historically, byte referred to the amount of memory needed to store one character of text. The IBM 360 used an eight-bit byte for its text encoding, and due to the 360s overwhelming popularity, the Intel 8008 also used an eight-bit byte, even though it didn&#39;t support an eight-bit encoding scheme for text. Since then, 8 bits is a byte even though ASCII is 7 bits.</p>
<h4 id="byte-order-mark-bom">Byte Order Mark (BOM)</h4>
<p>a Unicode character, U+FEFF, when appearing as a magic number at the start of a text file can signal several things: (1) the byte order, or endianness of the text stream, (2) that the text encoding is Unicode, or (3) the particular Unicode encoding system.</p>
<p>Some Microsoft text software, like Notepad, requires the BOM to use UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>a function that can access its outer variables.</p>
<p>Unlike many languages, which do not allow closures or require special techniques, in JavaScript nearly all functions are closures because functions in JavaScript retain an internal reference to the lexical environment that created it.</p>
<p>Sometimes people require that a closure be observable. In the code below, <code>bar()</code> does not reference bindings in its outer lexical environment and thus isn&#39;t an observable closure.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>() {
  let x = 1;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">bar</span>() {}
  bar();
}
foo();
</code></pre>
<p>In the code below, <code>bar()</code> does reference outer free variables, and therefore we have observed a function that is a closure.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

<p>behavior that affects disparate parts of a program and could be scattered or tangled throughout the program.</p>
<p>Cross-cutting concerns do not serve the primary role of the modules in which they exist, and they do not fit cleanly into object-oriented programming. Logging is a classic example.</p>

<h4 id="cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h4>
<p>in the context of web browsers, CORS is a security mechanism that allows a web page from one domain to access a resource from a different domain (cross-origin). CORS is a W3C standard.</p>
<p>Simple CORS requests are GET or POST requests that only allow modification of a handful of specific headers, notably the only allowed <code>content-types</code> values are <code>plain</code>, <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, or <code>multipart/form-data</code>. Simple CORS requests do not require a preflight request. All other CORS requests require a preflight request that asks the server if it will accept the request. If the server responds with the correct headers, the client will make the request. If the server does not respond with the correct headers, the client will not make the request. Non-simple CORS requests require two requests to the server, a preflight request and the actual request.</p>
<p>Requests made to different subdomains of the same domain are considered cross-origin and require CORS.</p>
<p>Note, <code>slack.com</code> makes all API requests to <code>api.slack.com</code> using <code>content-type: multipart/form-data</code> to keep the CORS requests simple. Responses can be of any content type.</p>

<h4 id="currying">Currying</h4>
<p>transforming a function with an arity of &gt;= two to a series of functions that each have an arity of one.</p>
<p>Currying is very useful in JavaScript because functions can only return a single value, so curried functions can be composed.</p>

<h4 id="cyclomatic-complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</h4>
<p>a metric used to measure the complexity of a program.</p>
<p>Cyclomatic complexity is calculated by counting the number of paths through the source code using control flow graphs. For instance, if the source code contained no branching points (<code>if</code> or <code>for</code> statements), the complexity would be one since there is only a single path. However, if the code had a single branching point (one <code>if</code> statement) then the complexity would be two.</p>

<p>Declarative programming relies on expressions rather than statements. Functional programming is characterized by using this style.</p>
<h4 id="declarative-vs-imperative">Declarative vs. Imperative</h4>
<p>declarative is to declare what one wants (HTML/CSS), and imperative is to state commands as to how to do it (JavaScript).</p>
<h4 id="decorator-function-decorators">Decorator Function, Decorators</h4>
<p>derived from the decorator pattern: A function that calls another function, and <em>decorates</em> it by adding additional functionality.</p>
<p>Often, decorators add generalized functionality to other more specific functions. In some languages, they have a specialized syntax.</p>
<p>Decorators are not supported in JavaScript, but they have been proposed.</p>

<h4 id="delegation">Delegation</h4>
<p>when a sender object method is called, and it actually calls another object&#39;s (receiver) method. In the receiver&#39;s called method, <code>this</code> refers to the sender object.</p>
<p>JavaScript&#39;s <em>call()</em> and <em>apply()</em> are explicit delegation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Delegation is commonly confused with forwarding. The difference between delegation and forwarding is that for forwarding, <em>this</em> refers to the receiver, unlike delegation, where <code>this</code> refers to the sender.</p>
<p>A great example on Stack Overflow is to think of receiving an email asking you to donate money to a charity. If you forward the email to a friend who gives money, this is forwarding. If you delegate responding to your accountant, who donates your money, this is delegation.</p>

<h4 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</h4>
<ul>
<li>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, such as interfaces.</li>
<li>Abstractions should not depend on details. Details, such as concrete implementations, should depend on abstractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of high-level modules creating hard dependencies to low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions that generalize the modules&#39; interactions rather than involving implementation details. This technique works to decouple modules.</p>
<p>This principle <em>inverts</em> the common scenario, which is high-level modules coupling themselves to low-level modules via hardwired dependencies.</p>

<p>a domain name is a human-readable name that is used to identify a website. Domain names are organized in a hierarchy, with the right-most label representing the top-level domain (TLD). The TLD is followed by the second-level domain (SLD) and then any further domain names. For example, <code>www.example.com</code> has a gTLD of <code>com</code>, an SLD of <code>example</code>, and a third-level domain of <code>www</code>. <code>www.example.co.uk</code> has a ccTLD of <code>uk</code>, an SLD of <code>co</code>, a third-level domain of <code>example</code>, and a fourth-level domain of <code>www</code>.</p>
<p>Effective TLDs are used to identify the actual top-level domain in a given domain name, taking into account country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and generic top-level domains (gTLDs). For example, <code>www.example.co.uk</code> has an eTLD of <code>co.uk</code> and <code>youtube.com</code> has a eTLD of <code>com</code>. eTLDs are useful to get the actual &quot;site&quot; address.</p>
<p>The actual &quot;site&quot; name is the label that follows the eTLD. Often, the eTLD plus the next label is known as the eTLD+1. The <code>eTLD+1</code> is the registerable domain name. Any further labels are subdomains.</p>
<p>eTLD+1 examples: <code>nytimes.com</code>, <code>telegraph.co.uk</code>. These are what are registered by the owner of the domain.</p>

<p>For example, JavaScript is not forwards compatible because if you use a feature from ES2019 in a browser from 2005, it breaks the old browser. CSS, on the other hand, is forwards compatible because if you included a new CSS directive in a browser from 2005, it would not break the page but would instead be skipped. The ancient browser is forwards compatible with regard to CSS.</p>
<h4 id="forwarding">Forwarding</h4>
<p>when a sender object method is called, and it actually calls another object&#39;s (receiver) method.</p>

<p>Parametricity is the idea that a polymorphic function will act on all types in a uniform manner.</p>
<p>For example, <code>// sum :: a -&gt; a</code>. Since <code>a</code> is not a specific type, the function will act on all passed types uniformly.</p>
<p>Knowing this provides us with <em>free theorems</em> about the behavior of the function. They are <em>free</em> because you do not need to look at the function&#39;s code to derive them.</p>
<h4 id="free-variables">Free Variables</h4>
<p>with regard to a function, a variable that is used but is not declared locally and not passed as a parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">let x;

<p>a programming paradigm that focuses on immutable data, first-class functions, higher-order functions, pure functions, referential transparency, and recursion.</p>
<p>FP can deliver code that is more concise than imperative programming but is typically harder to understand.</p>
<p>Often, FP is considered declarative because the focus is on expressing what is done rather than how.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to get ten programmers in a room to fully agree on a definition of FP.</p>
<h4 id="functor">Functor</h4>
<p>practically speaking, a data structure that wraps a value and provides a <code>map</code> method; <code>map</code> runs over the wrapped value and returns another functor of the same type that wraps the newly mapped value.</p>
<p>Arrays in JavaScript are functors. <code>[1, 2, 3].map(x =&gt; 2 * x) // [2, 4, 6]</code></p>
<p>Functors come from category theory and observe a set of functor laws that ensure they can be composed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserves Identity. <br><code>functor.map(x =&gt; x) ≍ functor</code></li>
<li>Composable. <br><code>functor.map(compose(f, g)) ≍ functor.map(g).map(f)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, this is a reductive definition of functors but is essentially accurate.</p>
<p>Functors are also known as containers, wrapped values, boxes, mappables, and many other terms.</p>

<p>objects supplied by a runtime environment.</p>
<p>For example, a browser provides the <code>window</code> object.</p>
<h4 id="html-tags-vs-elements">HTML: Tags vs. Elements</h4>
<p>a tag in HTML is the opening or closing entity for an element, and an element is an entire entity.</p>
<p>An element includes the tags and the element&#39;s content.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- &lt;div&gt; is a tag and &lt;/div&gt; is a tag --&gt;</span>

<li>PUT: Replace the target resource with the request payload.</li>
<li>DELETE: Delete the targeted resource.</li>
<li>CONNECT: Start a two-way communication with the targeted resource.</li>

<li>TRACE: Sends back the exact request for debugging purposes.</li>
<li>PATCH: Partially modify the targeted resource with the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some are actually nouns. Thus, I think the authors must be using &quot;verb&quot; to refer to the concept of performing an action rather than the grammatical concept of a verb.</p>
<h4 id="hungarian-notation">Hungarian Notation</h4>
<p>a naming convention where the prefix for a variable is the value&#39;s type.</p>
<p>For example, <code>let longAddress = &quot;4657 Decatur...&quot;</code> would be <code>let stringLongAddress = &quot;4657 Decatur...&quot;</code> in Hungarian notation.</p>
<p><em>Hungarian</em> because in Hungary, a person&#39;s name is reversed, meaning that the family name precedes the given name. I would be <em>Knerr Jake</em>. I think Japanese is the same.</p>

<h4 id="object-composition-black-box-reuse">Object Composition, Black-Box Reuse</h4>
<p>very generally, creating parent objects (composites) that contain child objects to reuse functionality.</p>
<p>Composition implies ownership. When the parent object is destroyed, all child objects are also destroyed. If child objects can exist independently of the parent object, then this is aggregation.</p>
<p>Parent and child objects interact through each others&#39; interfaces. The parent (composer) composes the child (composed).</p>

<h4 id="semantic-versioning-semver">Semantic Versioning (semver)</h4>
<p>a popular software versioning system used in most open-source projects.</p>
<p>Broadly, the versioning system is <code>major.minor.patch</code>. <code>Major</code> changes are for incompatible API changes. <code>Minor</code> changes add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. <code>Patch</code> changes are for backwards-compatible bug fixes.</p>
<p>Versions can also inlcude an optional pre-release label following a <code>-</code> after the patch number and a build number following a <code>+</code> after the pre-release label. For example, <code>1.1.1-unstable+1</code> indicates that this is a pre-release buld labeled <code>unstable</code> with a build number of <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The Node.js implementation of semver also introduces shorthand ranges <code>~</code> and <code>^</code>. The <code>~</code> character defines a range of acceptable versions for patches. <code>~1.2.3</code> can be interpreted as <code>&gt;=1.2.3 &amp; &lt;1.3.0</code>. The <code>^</code> character defines a range of acceptable versions for patches and minor versions. So <code>^1.2.3</code> can be interpreted as <code>&gt;=1.2.3 &amp; &lt;2.0.0</code>.</p>

<h4 id="trampolining">Trampolining</h4>
<p>a technique used to limit the growth of the call stack by not making the final continuation call inside the called function, but rather exit and return the continuation call to a trampoline that then loops and invokes the continuations.</p>
<p>Imagine how a recursive function keeps adding to the call stack with each recursive iteration. Because of this, memory consumption can grow out of control. Now, instead of immediately calling the recursive function, return the intent to call the recursive function to a trampoline, which allows the initial function to end, get popped off the call stack, and then the trampoline calls the recursive function. This technique keeps the call stack from growing.</p>
